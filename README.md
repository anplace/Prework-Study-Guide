# Alex Place's Prework Project

## Description

This application is my introductory work in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents a basic understanding of the languages but creates a fantastic foundation for future use. I'm hoping that this project will lead me into a computer science career. My future plans, if all goes well, is to start a Masters program in Computer Science within 6-18 months.

## Installation

## Usage

This application will be used for testing of new code, building off this basic code for larger projects, and referencing code if needed, in the future.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

Color schematic has changed from the blue and gray to Orange, Black, and Purple. Code also has a randomizer in it to decide what program to learn first and can then be used to decide which language should be learned next. 

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
